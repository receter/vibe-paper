# Paper App - Cursor AI Context

## Project Overview
This is the Paper app - a minimalist note-taking application focused on distraction-free writing.

## Architecture Reference
Please read `architecture.md` for detailed information about:
- System architecture and design decisions
- Technology stack and rationale
- Component structure and data flow
- Storage strategy and performance considerations

## Key Files
- `architecture.md` - Complete architecture documentation
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/styles/` - CSS styling
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions

## Development Guidelines
- Keep the UI minimal and distraction-free
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the architecture decisions documented in `architecture.md`
- Maintain the auto-save functionality
- Ensure localStorage operations are efficient

## Code Style
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Keep components small and focused
- Use CSS for styling (no external UI libraries)
- Follow the existing ESLint and Prettier configuration

## Testing Notes
- Test localStorage functionality across browser sessions
- Verify auto-save works correctly
- Ensure random name generation produces unique names
- Test sidebar functionality and note switching

## Important: 
Always refer to `architecture.md` when making significant changes to understand the design decisions and maintain consistency with the overall architecture.
